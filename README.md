Regression (Typed Racket)
=========================

After watching a couple of Andrew Ng's lectures on machine learning I was inspired to try write my own implementation of the simplest gradient descent algorithms in (fairly) idiomatic C++11. This project is a quick re-write in Typed Racket, to try out the new math libraries.

Both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are implemented, and with the appropriate hypothesis functions it's possible to perform linear regression and logistic regression. The simple tests show it working fairly neatly on simple examples.
